# This cmake find module looks for the header files and libraries from the
# 'libnifti1-dev' package.
#
# The following variables will be exported:
#
# NIFTI_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory that contains nifti1.h
# NIFTI_NIFTICDF_LIBRARY - the libnifticdf library file
# NIFTI_NIFTIIO_LIBRARY - the libniftiio library file
# NIFTI_ZNZ_LIBRARY - the libznz library file
# NIFTI_FOUND - TRUE if and only if ALL other variables have
# correct values.
